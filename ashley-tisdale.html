She often co-writes the songs she records; for her debut album Headstrong, she had writing credits in four songs, while she co-wrote five tracks for her album Guilty Pleasure. The songs in which she has songwriting credits are often personal. In 2009, while discussing the songs she co-wrote for her second studio album, Tisdale said that “a lot of the songs on the album [were] about survival and staying strong” and that she wanted those songs to be “a statement and a reflection of what [she went] through over the past year and how [she has] grown up.” She named the song “What If” as the most personal song she co-wrote for Guilty Pleasure. She discussed the death of her grandfather in the song “You’re Always Here”, which she wrote with her husband French.</p><h2>Ashley Tisdale Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ashley Tisdale is one of the <strong>richest Tv Actress</strong> from United States.
